# VideoGameShowcase

These are the DOS games that I made in C++(one is in Java).

I want you to see the games in the following order
  1. MasterMind
  2. Connect4
  3. Reversed
  4. Tennis Bluff

The game that i reconstructed is MasterMind, it has a better user interface, and its code is well encapsulated. This is the game whose code I recommend you to see if you wish to dive in the code. The other games weren't designed keeping scalability in mind, so their code is not well managed.

There is also a game called Pythons. Its written in python using pygame. It may not be revelant, but I added it allthesame. You need python and pygame to run it. If you don't have these and still want to see it, message me, I will upload an executable.

I added a unity game too just for fun. It was the first thing I made in Unity. Its more like me trying random stuff and learning Unity, so its not really a full fledged game, but yeah it works.
