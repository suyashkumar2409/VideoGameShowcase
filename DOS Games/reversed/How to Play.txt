Use "A" and "D" for left and right.

Navigate through the holes in the walls.

If at any point, you hear a sound, it means the controls have been reversed.

That means now, "D" is for left and "A" is right.


Look at the bottom left of the screen to know whether the controls are "correct" or reversed.
